Spread all over the map you will find _Places_. 
Every place has it's specified position and an item it produces or gives out. If you have a job that needs an items from somewhere, you have to drive to the place that produces this required item.
You can see a list of all places when you use the `/addressbook` command and view details about your current place using `/position`

Some actions are bound to these places. You will see them as special buttons when you drive.

By the way, enjoy the place images and look for details. They are gorgeous.
