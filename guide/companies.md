Companies are going to become a core part of the economy. Everytime you complete a job, a small amount of your payout will be added to your companies net worth.
Anyone can found a own company and hire members. It's logo will be visible to anyone on the map on the place you want to have your company headquarters.


**Future plans:**
Core parts of the economy system will be changed. 
Current plans are a deeper integration of the companies in the payout and job system. 
 
In the future jobs will only add money to your company and you as a driver get it payed out on a monthly basis. The money your company doesn't pay out can then later be invested in better trucks and other stuff.
