**Hey there, fellow Trucker,**

My name is Mr Thomas Ruck and I am the founder of this Trucking company.
We get jobs from all around the country and distribute them among all registered drivers that use `t.job`

Your level represents your reputation. The higher it is, the more money you receive from jobs. If you make mistakes, your level will be lowered.

Driving is pretty simple. Just press all those fancy buttons but please note that you have to stop your truck before you do any action.
You can't load a truck driving at 100 mph in real life, can you?

Have a lot of fun on the roads.

**Sincerely
Mr T. Ruck**
